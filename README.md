# SpendWise — Personal Finance & Expense Tracker

🚀 **Live Demo:** https://expense-tracker-lake-seven-35.vercel.app

A full-stack personal finance tracker that lets users manage multiple accounts, record transactions, transfer money between accounts, set budgets, track recurring payments, and view reports — all with correct money handling, atomic transfers, concurrency control, and a complete audit trail.

This is not just a CRUD app. Money-handling systems have real correctness requirements: balances must always be accurate, history must never silently change, and concurrent edits must not corrupt data.

---

## Features

### Accounts
- Create and manage multiple accounts (Checking, Savings, Credit Card, Cash, Other)
- Each account has a name, type, currency, and balance
- Balance is always derivable from transaction history — never overwritten freely
- Per-user data isolation (one user can never see another user's accounts)

### Transactions
- Record income and expenses with amount, date, category, description
- **Soft delete only** — transactions are never hard-deleted; "deleting" creates a reversing entry and the original remains visible in history
- All monetary values stored as `decimal` (see below for why)

### Transfers Between Accounts
- Move money between accounts (e.g., Checking → Savings)
- Modeled as **two linked entries** (debit + credit) that always net to zero
- Created **atomically** — if one side fails, neither persists

### Categories
- User-defined categories for income and expenses
- Each transaction belongs to exactly one category

### Recurring Transactions
- Define rules like "Rent, $1200, Checking, 1st of the month"
- Projected upcoming transactions visible without pre-inserting future rows
- Background service generates real transactions when the scheduled date arrives

### Budgets & Alerts
- Set monthly budgets per category (e.g., "$500/month on Dining")
- Track actual spend against budget in real time
- Background service detects overspend and generates in-app alerts

### CSV Import
- Import bank statements from CSV
- Duplicate detection (same date + amount + description)
- Malformed rows reported individually — the whole import never crashes
- Preview parsed transactions before committing

### Reporting
- Monthly spend by category
- Balance-over-time / net worth trend
- Income vs. expense summary for a selected date range

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- All financial data scoped to the logged-in user
- Users can never query another user's data, even by guessing IDs

### Concurrency Control
- Optimistic concurrency on accounts via `RowVersion` token
- Concurrent edits return a clean error instead of silently overwriting

### Audit Trail
- Every transaction change (create, edit, soft-delete) is recorded with a timestamp

## Why I Used `decimal` (Not `float`/`double`) For Money

All monetary values use C#'s `decimal` type — never `float` or `double`.

`float` and `double` are binary floating-point types. They can't represent most decimal fractions exactly, so tiny rounding errors creep in:

```csharp
double a = 0.1;
double b = 0.2;
double sum = a + b;

Console.WriteLine(sum);  // 0.30000000000000004
```

The result should be `0.3`, but `double` returns `0.30000000000000004`. That tiny error is invisible in a single calculation — but over thousands of transactions, it compounds into real money being wrong.

`decimal` is a base-10 type designed for financial math. It represents `0.1` and `0.2` exactly, so `0.1 + 0.2` equals `0.3` — always.

**Result:** Account balances are always exact. Reports never drift. Money doesn't silently lose fractions of a cent.

## How To Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (for the database)
- .NET SDK 10
- Node.js 20+

### 1. Start the database

From the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up postgres -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL 15 on port `5433`.

### 2. Run the backend

```bash
cd Backend
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:7000`.

### 3. Run the frontend

```bash
cd Fronted
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` (or `3000` — check the terminal output).

### 4. Open the app

```
http://localhost:5173
```

Register a user, log in, and start using the app.

---

## Running With Docker Compose (Full Stack)

To run everything in containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

To stop:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To reset the database:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`.env` or Render dashboard)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JwtSettings__Key` | JWT signing key (32+ chars) |
| `JwtSettings__Issuer` | JWT issuer |
| `JwtSettings__Audience` | JWT audience |
| `EmailSettings__SmtpHost` | SMTP host |
| `EmailSettings__SmtpPort` | SMTP port |
| `EmailSettings__SmtpUsername` | SMTP username |
| `EmailSettings__SmtpPassword` | SMTP password / app password |
| `EmailSettings__FromEmail` | Sender email |
| `EmailSettings__FromName` | Sender display name |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | `Production` in prod, `Development` locally |

### Frontend (`.env` or Vercel dashboard)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend API base URL |

**Note:** Secrets are never committed to this repo. `appsettings.json` contains placeholders only; real values live in `appsettings.Development.json` (gitignored) or platform environment variables.

## Database Migrations

Migrations are applied automatically on backend startup. To create a new migration:

```bash
cd Backend
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
```

To apply manually:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

## Testing

The project includes:

- Unit tests for balance calculation
- Transfer atomicity tests
- CSV duplicate-detection tests

Run tests:

```bash
cd Tests
dotnet test
```

---

## Deployment

- **Backend:** Deployed on [Render](https://render.com) as a Docker container, auto-deploying from `main`
- **Frontend:** Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), auto-deploying from `main`
- **Database:** Render-managed PostgreSQL 15

Every push to `main` triggers automatic redeployment of both services.

---

## Known Limitations

- **In-memory cache** (if used) resets on backend restart
- **Render free tier:** backend sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity — first request after sleep takes 30–60 seconds
